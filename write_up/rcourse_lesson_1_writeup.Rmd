This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
load("rcourse_lesson1_environment.RData")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Data
Here is a look at our two data frames. First is the one we read in, the second is our subset of just the bilinguals' data.
```{r}
head(data)
head(data_bl)
```
# Figure
Here's a figure of the bilinguals compared to the monolinguals.
```{r, fig.align='center'}
data.plot
```
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
